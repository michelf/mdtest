MDTest
======

Markdown/Markdown Extra Test Suite


Introduction
------------

MDTest is a Markdown test suite derived from the older MarkdownTest by 
John Gruber. MDTest is primarily used for the development of PHP Markdown
but is structured in a way so that it can test and benchmark various implementations.


Test Suites
-----------

MDTest splits its tests into "mdtest" folders. The MDTest command line tool
will run the test for the specified test suite if specified, or all of them
if unspecified.

### Markdown.mdtest

The *Markdown* test suite folder contains the original Markdown test suite from
MarkdownTest. It was written by John Gruber to test Markdown.pl.

### PHP Markdown.mdtest

The *PHP Markdown* test suite folder contains complementary tests for 
PHP Markdown not included in the Markdown test suite.

### PHP Markdown Extra.mdtest

The *PHP Markdown Extra* test suite folder contains tests for features added
to PHP Markdown Extra and not present in regular Markdown.


Requirement
-----------

This library package should be run with PHP 5.3 or later.


Usage
-----

### Command Line

To run MDTest you need a Markdown parser. You can supply the parser as a function to call after loading a PHP library or as an executable script taking input from STDIN and emiting its output to STDOUT.

For instance, if you are testing PHP Markdown, use this command:

	./mdtest.php -f \\Michelf\\Markdown::defaultTransform

This will make MDTest autoload the `\Michelf\Markdown` class and call its `defaultTransform` static method. (Note that you need to escape backslashes on the shell by prefixing them with another backslash. You may also want to run `git submodule init` to get PHP Markdown Lib installed in your Implementations folder.)

For external scripts that need to run as a separate process you pass the path to the script instead:

	./mdtest.php -s path/to/parser-executable

By default, MDTest will run tests from all folders with a `.mdtest` extension it can find in the current directory. If no script or function is specified, it tries to 

Use the `-?` option to get a complete list of available options.

### Web Interface

The `index.php` file provides a rudimentary web interface for MDTest. It let you choose from a list of implementations in the Implementaiton folder and displays the output of the test script.
